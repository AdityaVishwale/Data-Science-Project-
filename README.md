# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Predictive Modeling.

- The primary objective is to understand the factors influencing customer churn and build machine learning models to predict churn. â€‹
- By doing so, the telecom company can proactively implement retention strategies, thereby reducing customer attrition and improving overall business performance.

1. Description: Contains customer information for a subscription-based service provider to predict customer churn (leaving the service).
2. Columns: Includes customer details, services used, contract terms, and churn status.
3. Purpose: Used for customer churn analysis, segmentation, and retention strategies.
4. Applications: Churn prediction, customer satisfaction analysis, and targeted marketing.
5. Analysis Tasks: EDA, data pre-processing, ML model building, evaluation, and model deployment.

* Choosing a Machine Learning Algorithm: Select the right algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Adaboost, XG Boost) for your problem.
* Training and Evaluating the Model: Cover the process of training and evaluating the model to ensure its robust and reliable.
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for improved performance.
* Model Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall to assess how well the model is performing.
